# *Realtime-Fish-Detection-GUI*![License: Proprietary](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Proprietary-red.svg)

It is an AI Hybrid Framework Graphical User Interface system consisting of Real-Time Underwater Fish Detection using two Machine Learning algorithms &amp; traditional Computer Vision Algorithm and an Image Enhancement Pipeline to improve the Efficiency and Accuracy.

This was my research work in NIOT (National Institute Of Ocean Technology) as a Project Trainee in Underwater Image/Video Processing Domain under Computer Infrastructure Group (CIG). In our GUI, I have provided buttons to enhance,detect and download the images or videos. Furthertime, I would like to enhance my GUI by adding more features and integrating livestream facility to it, it would bring tremendous change in the AI and Oceans Research Industry.

# My work would be explained in a step wise manner below :-
1) Image Enhanacement 
2) Working with Various Object Detection Models.
3) Collecting Datasets.
4) Training Datasets with my selected models (*the most difficult task*).
5) Testing and Validation.
6) Creating a GUI using PAGE (Python Based GUI Generator).
7) Integrating all Functions to the GUI Code.
8) Testing and Modification. 
9) Deploying it in Real-Time applications.
10) Collecting Results and comparison.
11) Adding more images to datasets and repeating the process from step 4 for better accuracy and efficiency.

# Files present in my repository:-
1) Fish Detection GUI code
2) YOLOv11 Training and Validation Code
3) FasterRCNN Training and Validation Code
